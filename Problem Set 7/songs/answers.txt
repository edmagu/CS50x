In this problem set, I learned how to use SQL to analyze structured data by writing queries to select, filter, and join tables. It showed me how relational databases like SQLite store information efficiently and how SQL can be used to extract insights, such as the most danceable or energetic songs. I also realized how a company like Spotify could use this kind of data for personalized recommendations and features like Spotify Wrapped. Understanding how to calculate averages and filter by attributes helped me see how small queries can form the foundation of large-scale analytics systems.
